<p>Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the
needle with which to bind this book. Start in from
the outside as shown on the diagram here. Pass the
needle and thread through the center of the book,
leaving an end extend outside, then through to the
outside, about 2 inches from the center; then from
the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the
other end of the book, bringing the thread finally

<p class="h2">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>

<p class="noindent">This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN
BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas
Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers
for Children," "Music Talks with Children," "First
Studies in Music Biography," and others.</p>

<p>The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut
apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its
proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing
the same number as will be found under each picture on the
sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture
with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within
the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic
paste, if possible.</p>

<p>After this play-work is completed there will be found at
the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to
write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts
and questions found on the previous pages.</p>

<p>The book is then to be sewed by the child through the
center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book
thus becomes the child's own book.</p>

<p>This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and
interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main
facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians&mdash;an
educational feature worth while.</p>

<p>A very odd house used to stand in the quaint old
Saxon City of Leipzig. This house was called the Red
and White Lion. I suppose no one ever really saw a
lion that was red and white, but nevertheless that was
the name of the house. There, was born Richard
Wagner, who was one day to write the wonderful
opera scenes of which we will soon read.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus02.png" alt="No. 2" title="No. 2" /><br />
<span class="caption">WAGNER&#39;S BIRTHPLACE</span>
</div>

<p>Richard Wagner's day of birth was May 22, 1813.
That was more than a century ago! More than twelve
hundred months!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Since that time, music has changed very greatly.
When Wagner was born, much of the music that was
being written had to follow certain patterns or models
just as architects follow certain patterns in building a
house. Now the composer when he writes music feels
a great deal freer as he knows that he can make his
own patterns,&mdash;that he is not held in by any such hard
laws as those which held back such composers as
Mozart, Bach, Haydn and Handel. It was Wagner
who did much to set music free from the old barriers.
This does not mean that
music to-day is better than
music that was written by
Haydn and Beethoven. Indeed
it often is not nearly so
good, but it is freer, less held
down by rule.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus03.png" alt="No. 3" title="No. 3" /><br />
<span class="caption">TANNHÄUSER</span>
</div>

<p>When Wagner wrote his
first opera that had any success
(Rienzi) he followed the
models of composers of the
day, but when he came to
write operas that followed,
such as Flying Dutchman,
Lohengrin and Tannhäuser,
he struck out in new and fresh paths which made him
many enemies at first and many friends later.</p>

<p>As we read of a great man we must learn to see the
world as it was in his day.</p>

<p>Today we think of the world as the home of our
parents, of ourselves and of our friends; as the world
of Mr. Edison, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Roosevelt. In the
world of Wagner there was not one of these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
Who were the great musicians when he was a boy?
Well, here are some of them. Can you tell one fact
about each of the men whose pictures come next?</p>

<p>Wagner's father died when he was only six
months old, and the boy was brought up by his
mother and his step-father, who was very kind to him.
In one way Wagner was unlike most of the other great
composers. He did not show any talent for music
until he was almost a man. All that he thought of
was writing plays. When he did study, he was so
bright and worked so hard that he learned in less than
a year more than many learn in a lifetime. Here is
a picture of Wagner's mother, who cared for him so
tenderly.</p>

When we read the stories of Charles Dickens we
make many friends. And they are among the very
best we ever have. There are Little Nell, Paul Dombey,
Sam Weller, Oliver Twist, and a host of others.</p>

<p>Writers like Dickens bring all sorts of people before
us. <i>But few composers can do such a thing.</i></p>

<p>Yet there are some who do this, and one of the
greatest is Richard Wagner. In his operas a host of
people live,&mdash;people as real and as interesting as those
in the stories of Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>There is Walter, who sings the Prize Song in Die
Meistersinger, and Eva, whom he loves. And in the
same opera there is Beckmesser, the fussy old schoolmaster
kind of a man. And Hans Sachs, the cobbler.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus09.png" alt="No. 9" title="No. 9" /><br />
<span class="caption">SCENE FROM DIE MEISTERSINGER</span>
</div>

<p>There is a lovely scene in the third act of this opera.
We see a meadow light and bright in the sunshine.
A glistening river flows quietly through it. Everywhere
on the water there are boats. Scattered over
the meadow there are tents. Everybody is out for a
holiday time. All is lively and full of color and bright
and cheery. Now there pass before us the tradesmen
singing in chorus. There are cobblers and carpenters
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
led by the town pipers. And every trade sings
its own songs.</p>

<p>Then comes the scene in which Walter and Beckmesser
sing in contest. Beckmesser begins. He stutters
and stammers and struggles through his song.
And finally, like a school-boy who does not know his
lesson, he breaks down.</p>

<p>Then Walter comes to sing the lovely <i>Prize Song</i>;
a melody that just sings itself into the heart of everyone.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus10.png" alt="No. 10" title="No. 10" /><br />
<span class="caption">WALTER&#39;S PRIZE SONG <a href="music/wagner.mid">Listen</a></span>
</div>

<p>Do you wonder that with such lovely music Walter
wins the contest and the hand of Eva whom he loves?
Jolly old Hans Sachs is so happy over it all that he
sings a rollicking song and everybody joins in with
him as the curtain goes down.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus11.png" alt="No. 11" title="No. 11" /><br />
<span class="caption">HANS SACHS</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Nor was Wagner satisfied with making characters
who were merely people just like ourselves. (For Walter
and Eva are people of our kind). But there are in
the operas by Richard Wagner, gods and goddesses,
giants and Rhine maidens, and Nibelungs.</p>

<p>Many of them have strange names. These names
are easy to remember because they are strange:
Wotan and Donner are gods. Freia and Erda are
goddesses. Fafner is a giant. Flosshilde is a Rhine
daughter. Mime and Alberich are Nibelungs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus12.png" alt="No. 12" title="No. 12" /><br />
<span class="caption">LOHENGRIN</span>
</div>

<p>Oh, they are wonderful company these gods and
goddesses, and others of the company who tell their
story and adventure in the operas of the Nibelungen
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
Ring. Here is Siegfried forging his Magic Sword
Nothung.</p>

<span class="caption">SIEGFRIED</span>
</div>

<p>Now, as we have said, when
we learn of so great a man we
always wonder what sort of a
boy he was. Well, when this boy
was nine years old he went to a
classical school. One of his teachers
at least must have been very
fond of him, and he must have
been fond of his teacher, for
when Richard Wagner was only
thirteen years old he translated from Greek into German
twelve books of the Odyssey for this teacher.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus14.png" alt="No. 14" title="No. 14" /><br />
<span class="caption">WAGNER AS A BOY</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
"I intend to become a poet," he used to say. He
read <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in English. Then he wrote
a play in which were <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>King Lear</i>. And
there were forty-two other characters. All of these
died or were killed in the fourth act and were brought
back as ghosts in the fifth! He played the piano, too,
and seems to have been quite as busy a boy as he was
a man.</p>

<p>Of one composer's music he
was very fond. This composer
lived nearby and passed the
Wagner house almost every day.
Richard always ran to the window
to watch him coming. This
musician was the composer of
<i>Der Freischütz</i> and of <i>Oberon</i>. Can
you guess his name?</p>

<p>This composer's father was
also a musician as well as a military
man.</p>

<span class="caption">WEBER</span>
</div>

<p>Children will be glad to know
that Wagner was very fond of
animals. Here he is with a picture
of one of his dogs. His
favorite dogs are buried in the
garden of his home at Bayreuth,
where Wagner is also buried.</p>

<p>Wagner called his home at
Bayreuth "Wahnfried," which
really means "Fancy Free."</p>

<p>It is beautifully located in the
heart of the old town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
Later on the boy read about the contest of <i>Die
Meistersinger</i>. He was then sixteen. And he read,
too, a poem called <i>Tannhäuser</i>. He kept these stories
in mind until he became a man and then he wrote an
opera about each.</p>

<p>Thus we see that we carry childhood thoughts into
manhood.</p>

<p>Wagner also wrote symphonies and a few works
for chorus and orchestra, but he is so much greater
as a composer of music dramas that he is known
mostly for his works for the stage.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
